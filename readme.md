# Virtual Mouse Gesture Controller
 This project allows users to control the mouse cursor and perform left/right clicks using hand gestures. It uses OpenCV for real-time video capture, MediaPipe for hand gesture recognition, and PyAutoGUI for mouse control. By recognizing specific hand gestures like "pinch" and "double-finger," the program simulates mouse actions.
 ## Features
 - Hand Gesture Recognition: Detects and interprets hand gestures using MediaPipe.
 - Mouse Movement: Controls the mouse cursor position based on hand gestures.
 - Left Click (Pinch Gesture): Simulates a left-click when a pinch gesture (thumb and index finger close) is detected.
 - Right Click (Double Finger Gesture): Simulates a right-click when the index and middle fingers are close together.
 - Real-time Processing: Captures video frames in real-time using OpenCV and processes hand gestures.
## Requirements
 - OpenCV (opencv-python): Used for real-time video capture, image processing, and displaying the video frames.

```
pip install opencv-python
```
 - MediaPipe (mediapipe): Used for hand gesture recognition and hand tracking.
```
pip install mediapipe
```
 - PyAutoGUI (pyautogui): Used for controlling the mouse, including moving the cursor and simulating mouse clicks.
```
pip install pyautogui
```
### Installation
